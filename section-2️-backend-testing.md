## ⚪ ️2.1 Enrich your testing portfolio: Look beyond unit tests and the pyramid

:white*check_mark: **Do:** The [testing pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html), though 10> years old, is a great and relevant model that suggests three testing types and influences most developers’ testing strategy. At the same time, more than a handful of shiny new testing techniques emerged and are hiding in the shadows of the testing pyramid. Given all the dramatic changes that we’ve seen in the recent 10 years (Microservices, cloud, serverless), is it even possible that one quite-old model will suit \_all* types of applications? shouldn’t the testing world consider welcoming new testing techniques?

Don’t get me wrong, in 2019 the testing pyramid, TDD and unit tests are still a powerful technique and are probably the best match for many applications. Only like any other model, despite its usefulness, [it must be wrong sometimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong). For example, consider an IOT application that ingests many events into a message-bus like Kafka/RabbitMQ, which then flow into some data-warehouse and are eventually queried by some analytics UI. Should we really spend 50% of our testing budget on writing unit tests for an application that is integration-centric and has almost no logic? As the diversity of application types increase (bots, crypto, Alexa-skills) greater are the chances to find scenarios where the testing pyramid is not the best match.

It’s time to enrich your testing portfolio and become familiar with more testing types (the next bullets suggest few ideas), mind models like the testing pyramid but also match testing types to real-world problems that you’re facing (‘Hey, our API is broken, let’s write consumer-driven contract testing!’), diversify your tests like an investor that build a portfolio based on risk analysis — assess where problems might arise and match some prevention measures to mitigate those potential risks

A word of caution: the TDD argument in the software world takes a typical false-dichotomy face, some preach to use it everywhere, others think it’s the devil. Everyone who speaks in absolutes is wrong :]

❌ **Otherwise:** You’re going to miss some tools with amazing ROI, some like Fuzz, lint, and mutation can provide value in 10 minutes

## ⚪ ️2.2 Component testing might be your best affair

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Each unit test covers a tiny portion of the application and it’s expensive to cover the whole, whereas end-to-end testing easily covers a lot of ground but is flaky and slower, why not apply a balanced approach and write tests that are bigger than unit tests but smaller than end-to-end testing? Component testing is the unsung song of the testing world — they provide the best from both worlds: reasonable performance and a possibility to apply TDD patterns + realistic and great coverage.

Component tests focus on the Microservice ‘unit’, they work against the API, don’t mock anything which belongs to the Microservice itself (e.g. real DB, or at least the in-memory version of that DB) but stub anything that is external like calls to other Microservices. By doing so, we test what we deploy, approach the app from outwards to inwards and gain great confidence in a reasonable amount of time.
<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** You may spend long days on writing unit tests to find out that you got only 20% system coverage

<br/><br/>

## ⚪ ️2.3 Ensure new releases don’t break the API using

:white_check_mark: **Do:** So your Microservice has multiple clients, and you run multiple versions of the service for compatibility reasons (keeping everyone happy). Then you change some field and ‘boom!’, some important client who relies on this field is angry. This is the Catch-22 of the integration world: It’s very challenging for the server side to consider all the multiple client expectations — On the other hand, the clients can’t perform any testing because the server controls the release dates. [Consumer-driven contracts and the framework PACT](https://docs.pact.io/) were born to formalize this process with a very disruptive approach — not the server defines the test plan of itself rather the client defines the tests of the… server! PACT can record the client expectation and put in a shared location, “broker”, so the server can pull the expectations and run on every build using PACT library to detect broken contracts — a client expectation that is not met. By doing so, all the server-client API mismatches are caught early during build/CI and might save you a great deal of frustration
<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** The alternatives are exhausting manual testing or deployment fear

## ⚪ ️ 2.4 Test your middlewares in isolation

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Many avoid Middleware testing because they represent a small portion of the system and require a live Express server. Both reasons are wrong — Middlewares are small but affect all or most of the requests and can be tested easily as pure functions that get {req,res} JS objects. To test a middleware function one should just invoke it and spy ([using Sinon for example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon)) on the interaction with the {req,res} objects to ensure the function performed the right action. The library [node-mock-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-mocks-http) takes it even further and factors the {req,res} objects along with spying on their behavior. For example, it can assert whether the http status that was set on the res object matches the expectation (See example below)
<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** A bug in Express middleware === a bug in all or most requests

### :clap:Doing It Right Example: Testing middleware in isolation without issuing network calls and waking-up the entire Express machine

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/🔧%20Example%20using%20Jest-blue.svg "Examples with Jest")

```javascript
//the middleware we want to test
const unitUnderTest = require("./middleware");
const httpMocks = require("node-mocks-http");
//Jest syntax, equivelant to describe() & it() in Mocha
test("A request without authentication header, should return http status 403", () => {
  const request = httpMocks.createRequest({
    method: "GET",
    url: "/user/42",
    headers: {
      authentication: ""
    }
  });
  const response = httpMocks.createResponse();
  unitUnderTest(request, response);
  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(403);
});
```

## ⚪ ️2.5 Measure and refactor using static analysis tools

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Using static analysis tools helps by giving objective ways to improve code quality and keep your code maintainable. You can add static analysis tools to your CI build to abort when it finds code smells. Its main selling points over plain linting are the ability to inspect quality in the context of multiple files (e.g. detect duplications), perform advanced analysis (e.g. code complexity) and follow the history and progress of code issues. Two examples of tools you can use are [Sonarqube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) (2,600+ [stars](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube)) and [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) (1,500+ [stars](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate))

## ⚪ ️ 2.6 Check your readiness for Node-related chaos

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Weirdly, most software testings are about logic & data only, but some of the worst things that happen (and are really hard to mitigate) are infrastructural issues. For example, did you ever test what happens when your process memory is overloaded, or when the server/process dies, or does your monitoring system realizes when the API becomes 50% slower?. To test and mitigate these type of bad things — [Chaos engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) was born by Netflix. It aims to provide awareness, frameworks and tools for testing our app resiliency for chaotic issues. For example, one of its famous tools, [the chaos monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey), randomly kills servers to ensure that our service can still serve users and not relying on a single server (there is also a Kubernetes version, [kube-monkey](https://github.com/asobti/kube-monkey), that kills pods). All these tools work on the hosting/platform level, but what if you wish to test and generate pure Node chaos like check how your Node process copes with uncaught errors, unhandled promise rejection, v8 memory overloaded with the max allowed of 1.7GB or whether your UX stays satisfactory when the event loop gets blocked often? to address this I’ve written, [node-chaos](https://github.com/i0natan/node-chaos-monkey) (alpha) which provides all sort of Node-related chaotic acts
<br/>

## ⚪ ️2.7 Avoid global test fixtures and seeds, add data per-test

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Going by the golden rule (bullet 0), each test should add and act on its own set of DB rows to prevent coupling and easily reason about the test flow. In reality, this is often violated by testers who seed the DB with data before running the tests (also known as ‘test fixture’) for the sake of performance improvement. While performance is indeed a valid concern — it can be mitigated (see “Component testing” bullet), however, test complexity is a much painful sorrow that should govern other considerations most of the time. Practically, make each test case explicitly add the DB records it needs and act only on those records. If performance becomes a critical concern — a balanced compromise might come in the form of seeding the only suite of tests that are not mutating data (e.g. queries)
<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** Few tests fail, a deployment is aborted, our team is going to spend precious time now, do we have a bug? let’s investigate, oh no — it seems that two tests were mutating the same seed data

<br/>

<details><summary>✏ <b>Code Examples</b></summary>

<br/>

### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: tests are not independent and rely on some global hook to feed global DB data

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/🔧%20Example%20using%20Mocha-blue.svg "Examples with Mocha")

```javascript
before(() => {
  //adding sites and admins data to our DB. Where is the data? outside. At some external json or migration framework
  await DB.AddSeedDataFromJson('seed.json');
});
it("When updating site name, get successful confirmation", async () => {
  //I know that site name "portal" exists - I saw it in the seed files
  const siteToUpdate = await SiteService.getSiteByName("Portal");
  const updateNameResult = await SiteService.changeName(siteToUpdate, "newName");
  expect(updateNameResult).to.be(true);
});
it("When querying by site name, get the right site", async () => {
  //I know that site name "portal" exists - I saw it in the seed files
  const siteToCheck = await SiteService.getSiteByName("Portal");
  expect(siteToCheck.name).to.be.equal("Portal"); //Failure! The previous test change the name :[
});

```

<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: We can stay within the test, each test acts on its own set of data

```javascript
it("When updating site name, get successful confirmation", async () => {
  //test is adding a fresh new records and acting on the records only
  const siteUnderTest = await SiteService.addSite({
    name: "siteForUpdateTest"
  });
  const updateNameResult = await SiteService.changeName(siteUnderTest, "newName");
  expect(updateNameResult).to.be(true);
});
```
