# Section 4️⃣: Measuring Test Effectiveness

<br/><br/>

## ⚪ ️ 4.1 Get enough coverage for being confident, ~80% seems to be the lucky number

:white_check_mark: **Do:** The purpose of testing is to get enough confidence for moving fast, obviously the more code is tested the more confident the team can be. Coverage is a measure of how many code lines (and branches, statements, etc) are being reached by the tests. So how much is enough? 10–30% is obviously too low to get any sense about the build correctness, on the other side 100% is very expensive and might shift your focus from the critical paths to the exotic corners of the code. The long answer is that it depends on many factors like the type of application — if you’re building the next generation of Airbus A380 than 100% is a must, for a cartoon pictures website 50% might be too much. Although most of the testing enthusiasts claim that the right coverage threshold is contextual, most of them also mention the number 80% as a thumb of a rule ([Fowler: “in the upper 80s or 90s”](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html)) that presumably should satisfy most of the applications.

Implementation tips: You may want to configure your continuous integration (CI) to have a coverage threshold ([Jest link](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#collectcoverage-boolean)) and stop a build that doesn’t stand to this standard (it’s also possible to configure threshold per component, see code example below). On top of this, consider detecting build coverage decrease (when a newly committed code has less coverage) — this will push developers raising or at least preserving the amount of tested code. All that said, coverage is only one measure, a quantitative based one, that is not enough to tell the robustness of your testing. And it can also be fooled as illustrated in the next bullets

<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** Confidence and numbers go hand in hand, without really knowing that you tested most of the system — there will also be some fear. and fear will slow you down

## ⚪ ️ 4.2 Inspect coverage reports to detect untested areas and other oddities

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Some issues sneak just under the radar and are really hard to find using traditional tools. These are not really bugs but more of surprising application behavior that might have a severe impact. For example, often some code areas are never or rarely being invoked — you thought that the ‘PricingCalculator’ class is always setting the product price but it turns out it is actually never invoked although we have 10000 products in DB and many sales… Code coverage reports help you realize whether the application behaves the way you believe it does. Other than that, it can also highlight which types of code is not tested — being informed that 80% of the code is tested doesn’t tell whether the critical parts are covered. Generating reports is easy — just run your app in production or during testing with coverage tracking and then see colorful reports that highlight how frequent each code area is invoked. If you take your time to glimpse into this data — you might find some gotchas
<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** If you don’t know which parts of your code are left un-tested, you don’t know where the issues might come from

### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: What’s wrong with this coverage report?

Based on a real-world scenario where we tracked our application usage in QA and find out interesting login patterns (Hint: the amount of login failures is non-proportional, something is clearly wrong. Finally it turned out that some frontend bug keeps hitting the backend login API)

## ⚪ ️ 4.3 Measure logical coverage using mutation testing

:white_check_mark: **Do:** The Traditional Coverage metric often lies: It may show you 100% code coverage, but none of your functions, even not one, return the right response. How come? it simply measures over which lines of code the test visited, but it doesn’t check if the tests actually tested anything — asserted for the right response. Like someone who’s traveling for business and showing his passport stamps — this doesn’t prove any work done, only that he visited few airports and hotels.

Mutation-based testing is here to help by measuring the amount of code that was actually TESTED not just VISITED. [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) is a JavaScript library for mutation testing and the implementation is really neat:

(1) it intentionally changes the code and “plants bugs”. For example the code newOrder.price===0 becomes newOrder.price!=0. This “bugs” are called mutations

(2) it runs the tests, if all succeed then we have a problem — the tests didn’t serve their purpose of discovering bugs, the mutations are so-called survived. If the tests failed, then great, the mutations were killed.

Knowing that all or most of the mutations were killed gives much higher confidence than traditional coverage and the setup time is similar
<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** You’ll be fooled to believe that 85% coverage means your test will detect bugs in 85% of your code

### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: 100% coverage, 0% testing

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/🔨%20Example%20using%20Stryker-blue.svg "Using Stryker")

```javascript
function addNewOrder(newOrder) {
  logger.log(`Adding new order ${newOrder}`);
  DB.save(newOrder);
  Mailer.sendMail(newOrder.assignee, `A new order was places ${newOrder}`);

  return { approved: true };
}

it("Test addNewOrder, don't use such test names", () => {
  addNewOrder({ asignee: "John@mailer.com", price: 120 });
}); //Triggers 100% code coverage, but it doesn't check anything
```

<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Stryker reports, a tool for mutation testing, detects and counts the amount of code that is not tested (Mutations)

## ⚪ ️4.4 Preventing test code issues with Test linters

:white_check_mark: **Do:** A set of ESLint plugins were built specifically for inspecting the tests code patterns and discover issues. For example, [eslint-plugin-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-mocha) will warn when a test is written at the global level (not a son of a describe() statement) or when tests are [skipped](https://mochajs.org/#inclusive-tests) which might lead to a false belief that all tests are passing. Similarly, [eslint-plugin-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest) can, for example, warn when a test has no assertions at all (not checking anything)

<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** Seeing 90% code coverage and 100% green tests will make your face wear a big smile only until you realize that many tests aren’t asserting for anything and many test suites were just skipped. Hopefully, you didn’t deploy anything based on this false observation

### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: A test case full of errors, luckily all are caught by Linters

```javascript
describe("Too short description", () => {
  const userToken = userService.getDefaultToken() // *error:no-setup-in-describe, use hooks (sparingly) instead
  it("Some description", () => {});//* error: valid-test-description. Must include the word "Should" + at least 5 words
});

it.skip("Test name", () => {// *error:no-skipped-tests, error:error:no-global-tests. Put tests only under describe or suite
  expect("somevalue"); // error:no-assert
});

it("Test name", () => {*//error:no-identical-title. Assign unique titles to tests
});
```
