## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.1 Separate UI from functionality

:white_check_mark: **Do:** When focusing on testing component logic, UI details become a noise that should be extracted, so your tests can focus on pure data. Practically, extract the desired data from the markup in an abstract way that is not too coupled to the graphic implementation, assert only on pure data (vs HTML/CSS graphic details) and disable animations that slow down. You might get tempted to avoid rendering and test only the back part of the UI (e.g. services, actions, store) but this will result in fictional tests that don't resemble the reality and won't reveal cases where the right data doesn't even arrive in the UI

<br/>

‚ùå **Otherwise:** The pure calculated data of your test might be ready in 10ms, but then the whole test will last 500ms (100 tests = 1 min) due to some fancy and irrelevant animation

  // Act
  const { getAllByTestId } = render(<UsersList users={allUsers} showOnlyVIP={true} />);

  // Assert - Extract the data from the UI first
  const allRenderedUsers = getAllByTestId("user").map(uiElement => uiElement.textContent);
  const allRealVIPUsers = allUsers.filter(user => user.vip).map(user => user.name);
  expect(allRenderedUsers).toEqual(allRealVIPUsers); //compare data with data, no UI here

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.2 Query HTML elements based on attributes that are unlikely to change

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Query HTML elements based on attributes that are likely to survive graphic changes unlike CSS selectors and like form labels. If the designated element doesn't have such attributes, create a dedicated test attribute like 'test-id-submit-button'. Going this route not only ensures that your functional/logic tests never break because of look & feel changes but also it becomes clear to the entire team that this element and attribute are utilized by tests and shouldn't get removed

<br/>

‚ùå **Otherwise:** You want to test the login functionality that spans many components, logic and services, everything is set up perfectly - stubs, spies, Ajax calls are isolated. All seems perfect. Then the test fails because the designer changed the div CSS class from 'thick-border' to 'thin-border'

<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Querying an element using a dedicated attrbiute for testing

<h3>
  <Badge pill className="fixed_badge" variant="dark">
    <span data-testid="errorsLabel">{value}</span>

test("Whenever no data is passed to metric, show 0 as default", () => {
  // Arrange
  const metricValue = undefined;

  // Act
  const { getByTestId } = render(<dashboardMetric value={undefined} />);

  expect(getByTestId("errorsLabel").text()).toBe("0");
});
```

test("Whenever no data is passed, error metric shows zero", () => {
  // ...

  expect(wrapper.find("[className='d-flex-column']").text()).toBe("0");
});
```

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.3 Whenever possible, test with a realistic and fully rendered component

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Whenever reasonably sized, test your component from outside like your users do, fully render the UI, act on it and assert that the rendered UI behaves as expected. Avoid all sort of mocking, partial and shallow rendering - this approach might result in untrapped bugs due to lack of details and harden the maintenance as the tests mess with the internals (see bullet 'Favour blackbox testing'). If one of the child components is significantly slowing down (e.g. animation) or complicating the setup - consider explicitly replacing it with a fake

With all that said, a word of caution is in order: this technique works for small/medium components that pack a reasonable size of child components. Fully rendering a component with too many children will make it hard to reason about test failures (root cause analysis) and might get too slow. In such cases, write only a few tests against that fat parent component and more tests against its children

<br/>

‚ùå **Otherwise:** When poking into a component's internal by invoking its private methods, and checking the inner state - you would have to refactor all tests when refactoring the components implementation. Do you really have a capacity for this level of maintenance?

        <FiltersPanel showFilter={showFilters} title="Choose Filters" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

//Examples use React & Enzyme
test("Realistic approach: When clicked to show filters, filters are displayed", () => {
  // Arrange
  const wrapper = mount(<Calendar showFilters={false} />);

  // Act
  wrapper.find("button").simulate("click");

  // Assert
  expect(wrapper.text().includes("Choose Filter"));
  // This is how the user will approach this element: by text
});
```

### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: Mocking the reality with shallow rendering

```javascript
test("Shallow/mocked approach: When clicked to show filters, filters are displayed", () => {
  // Arrange
  const wrapper = shallow(<Calendar showFilters={false} title="Choose Filter" />);

  // Act
  wrapper
    .find("filtersPanel")
    .instance()
    .showFilters();
  // Tap into the internals, bypass the UI and invoke a method. White-box approach

  // Assert
  expect(wrapper.find("Filter").props()).toEqual({ title: "Choose Filter" });
  // what if we change the prop name or don't pass anything relevant?
});
```

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.4 Don't sleep, use frameworks built-in support for async events. Also try to speed things up

:white_check_mark: **Do:** In many cases, the unit under test completion time is just unknown (e.g. animation suspends element appearance) - in that case, avoid sleeping (e.g. setTimeOut) and prefer more deterministic methods that most platforms provide. Some libraries allows awaiting on operations (e.g. [Cypress cy.request('url')](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Unnecessary-Waiting)), other provide API for waiting like [@testing-library/dom method wait(expect(element))](https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-disappearance). Sometimes a more elegant way is to stub the slow resource, like API for example, and then once the response moment becomes deterministic the component can be explicitly re-rendered. When depending upon some external component that sleeps, it might turn useful to [hurry-up the clock](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/timer-mocks). Sleeping is a pattern to avoid because it forces your test to be slow or risky (when waiting for a too short period). Whenever sleeping and polling is inevitable and there's no support from the testing framework, some npm libraries like [wait-for-expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-for-expect) can help with a semi-deterministic solution
<br/>

‚ùå **Otherwise:** When sleeping for a long time, tests will be an order of magnitude slower. When trying to sleep for small numbers, test will fail when the unit under test didn't respond in a timely fashion. So it boils down to a trade-off between flakiness and bad performance

<br/>

<details><summary>‚úè <b>Code Examples</b></summary>

<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: E2E API that resolves only when the async operations is done (Cypress)

```javascript
// using Cypress
cy.get("#show-products").click(); // navigate
cy.wait("@products"); // wait for route to appear
// this line will get executed only when the route is ready
```

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Testing library that waits for DOM elements

```javascript
// @testing-library/dom
test("movie title appears", async () => {
  // element is initially not present...

  // wait for appearance
  await wait(() => {
    expect(getByText("the lion king")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  // wait for appearance and return the element
  const movie = await waitForElement(() => getByText("the lion king"));
});
```

### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: custom sleep code

```javascript
test("movie title appears", async () => {
  // element is initially not present...

  // custom wait logic (caution: simplistic, no timeout)
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    const found = getByText("the lion king");
    if (found) {
      clearInterval(interval);
      expect(getByText("the lion king")).toBeInTheDocument();
    }
  }, 100);

  // wait for appearance and return the element
  const movie = await waitForElement(() => getByText("the lion king"));

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.5 Watch how the content is served over the network

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/üîß%20Example%20using%20Google%20LightHouse-blue.svg "Examples with Lighthouse")

‚úÖ **Do:** Apply some active monitor that ensures the page load under real network is optimized - this includes any UX concern like slow page load or un-minified bundle. The inspection tools market is no short: basic tools like [pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/), AWS CloudWatch, [gcp StackDriver](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks/) can be easily configured to watch whether the server is alive and response under a reasonable SLA. This only scratches the surface of what might get wrong, hence it's preferable to opt for tools that specialize in frontend (e.g. [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), [pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)) and perform richer analysis. The focus should be on symptoms, metrics that directly affect the UX, like page load time, [meaningful paint](https://scotch.io/courses/10-web-performance-audit-tips-for-your-next-billion-users-in-2018/fmp-first-meaningful-paint), [time until the page gets interactive (TTI)](https://calibreapp.com/blog/time-to-interactive/). On top of that, one may also watch for technical causes like ensuring the content is compressed, time to the first byte, optimize images, ensuring reasonable DOM size, SSL and many others. It's advisable to have these rich monitors both during development, as part of the CI and most important - 24x7 over the production's servers/CDN

<br/>

‚ùå **Otherwise:** It must be disappointing to realize that after such great care for crafting a UI, 100% functional tests passing and sophisticated bundling - the UX is horrible and slow due to CDN misconfiguration

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.6 Stub flaky and slow resources like backend APIs

:white_check_mark: **Do:** When coding your mainstream tests (not E2E tests), avoid involving any resource that is beyond your responsibility and control like backend API and use stubs instead (i.e. test double). Practically, instead of real network calls to APIs, use some test double library (like [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/), [Test doubles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble), etc) for stubbing the API response. The main benefit is preventing flakiness - testing or staging APIs by definition are not highly stable and from time to time will fail your tests although YOUR component behaves just fine (production env was not meant for testing and it usually throttles requests). Doing this will allow simulating various API behavior that should drive your component behavior as when no data was found or the case when API throws an error. Last but not least, network calls will greatly slow down the tests

<br/>

‚ùå **Otherwise:** The average test runs no longer than few ms, a typical API call last 100ms>, this makes each test ~20x slower

<br/>

```javascript
// unit under test
export default function ProductsList() {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState(false);

  const fetchProducts = async () => {
    const products = await axios.get("api/products");
    setProducts(products);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProducts();
  }, []);

  return products ? <div>{products}</div> : <div data-testid="no-products-message">No products</div>;
}

// test
test("When no products exist, show the appropriate message", () => {
  // Arrange
  nock("api")
    .get(`/products`)
    .reply(404);

  // Act
  const { getByTestId } = render(<ProductsList />);

  // Assert
  expect(getByTestId("no-products-message")).toBeTruthy();
});
```

</details>

<br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.7 Have very few end-to-end tests that spans the whole system

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Although E2E (end-to-end) usually means UI-only testing with a real browser (See bullet 3.6), for other they mean tests that stretch the entire system including the real backend. The latter type of tests is highly valuable as they cover integration bugs between frontend and backend that might happen due to a wrong understanding of the exchange schema. They are also an efficient method to discover backend-to-backend integration issues (e.g. Microservice A sends the wrong message to Microservice B) and even to detect deployment failures - there are no backend frameworks for E2E testing that are as friendly and mature as UI frameworks like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [Pupeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). The downside of such tests is the high cost of configuring an environment with so many components, and mostly their brittleness - given 50 microservices, even if one fails then the entire E2E just failed. For that reason, we should use this technique sparingly and probably have 1-10 of those and no more. That said, even a small number of E2E tests are likely to catch the type of issues they are targeted for - deployment & integration faults. It's advisable to run those over a production-like staging environment

<br/>

‚ùå **Otherwise:** UI might invest much in testing its functionality only to realizes very late that the backend returned payload (the data schema the UI has to work with) is very different than expected

<br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.8 Speed-up E2E tests by reusing login credentials

:white_check_mark: **Do:** In E2E tests that involve a real backend and rely on a valid user token for API calls, it doesn't payoff to isolate the test to a level where a user is created and logged-in in every request. Instead, login only once before the tests execution start (i.e. before-all hook), save the token in some local storage and reuse it across requests. This seem to violate one of the core testing principle - keep the test autonomous without resources coupling. While this is a valid worry, in E2E tests performance is a key concern and creating 1-3 API requests before starting each individial tests might lead to horrible execution time. Reusing credentials doesn't mean the tests have to act on the same user records - if relying on user records (e.g. test user payments history) than make sure to generate those records as part of the test and avoid sharing their existence with other tests. Also remember that the backend can be faked - if your tests are focused on the frontend it might be better to isolate it and stub the backend API (see bullet 3.6).

<br/>

‚ùå **Otherwise:** Given 200 test cases and assuming login=100ms = 20 seconds only for logging-in again and again

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Logging-in before-all and not before-each

let authenticationToken;

// happens before ALL tests run
before(() => {
  cy.request('POST', 'http://localhost:3000/login', {
    username: Cypress.env('username'),
    password: Cypress.env('password'),
  })
  .its('body')
  .then((responseFromLogin) => {
    authenticationToken = responseFromLogin.token;
  })
})

// happens before EACH test
beforeEach(setUser => () {
  cy.visit('/home', {
    onBeforeLoad (win) {
      win.localStorage.setItem('token', JSON.stringify(authenticationToken))
    },
  })
})

```

</details>

<br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.9 Have one E2E smoke test that just travels across the site map

:white_check_mark: **Do:** For production monitoring and development-time sanity check, run a single E2E test that visits all/most of the site pages and ensures no one breaks. This type of test brings a great return on investment as it's very easy to write and maintain, but it can detect any kind of failure including functional, network and deployment issues. Other styles of smoke and sanity checking are not as reliable and exhaustive - some ops teams just ping the home page (production) or developers who run many integration tests which don't discover packaging and browser issues. Goes without saying that the smoke test doesn't replace functional tests rather just aim to serve as a quick smoke detector

<br/>

‚ùå **Otherwise:** Everything might seem perfect, all tests pass, production health-check is also positive but the Payment component had some packaging issue and only the /Payment route is not rendering

  cy.contains("https://mysite.com/Login");
  cy.contains("Login");
  cy.contains("https://mysite.com/About");
  cy.contains("About");
});
```

</details>

<br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.10 Expose the tests as a live collaborative document

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Besides increasing app reliability, tests bring another attractive opportunity to the table - serve as live app documentation. Since tests inherently speak at a less-technical and product/UX language, using the right tools they can serve as a communication artifact that greatly aligns all the peers - developers and their customers. For example, some frameworks allow expressing the flow and expectations (i.e. tests plan) using a human-readable language so any stakeholder, including product managers, can read, approve and collaborate on the tests which just became the live requirements document. This technique is also being referred to as 'acceptance test' as it allows the customer to define his acceptance criteria in plain language. This is [BDD (behavior-driven testing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) at its purest form. One of the popular frameworks that enable this is [Cucumber which has a JavaScript flavor](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), see example below. Another similar yet different opportunity, [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/), allows exposing UI components as a graphic catalog where one can walk through the various states of each component (e.g. render a grid w/o filters, render that grid with multiple rows or with none, etc), see how it looks like, and how to trigger that state - this can appeal also to product folks but mostly serves as live doc for developers who consume those components.

‚ùå **Otherwise:** After investing top resources on testing, it's just a pity not to leverage this investment and win great value

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.11 Detect visual issues with automated tools

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Setup automated tools to capture UI screenshots when changes are presented and detect visual issues like content overlapping or breaking. This ensures that not only the right data is prepared but also the user can conveniently see it. This technique is not widely adopted, our testing mindset leans toward functional tests but it's the visuals what the user experience and with so many device types it's very easy to overlook some nasty UI bug. Some free tools can provide the basics - generate and save screenshots for the inspection of human eyes. While this approach might be sufficient for small apps, it's flawed as any other manual testing that demands human labor anytime something changes. On the other hand, it's quite challenging to detect UI issues automatically due to the lack of clear definition - this is where the field of 'Visual Regression' chime in and solve this puzzle by comparing old UI with the latest changes and detect differences. Some OSS/free tools can provide some of this functionality (e.g. [wraith](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith), [PhantomCSS](<[https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS](https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS)>) but might charge signficant setup time. The commercial line of tools (e.g. [Applitools](https://applitools.com/), [Percy.io](https://percy.io/)) takes is a step further by smoothing the installation and packing advanced features like management UI, alerting, smart capturing by elemeinating 'visual noise' (e.g. ads, animations) and even root cause analysis of the DOM/css changes that led to the issue
